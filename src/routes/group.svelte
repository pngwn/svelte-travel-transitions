      Arrival: We settled in and decided to go snorkeling. We saw spotted
      dolphins, tons of whales - one whale went right under the boat, and, of
      course, plenty of sea turtles. The snorkeling area is a little small and
      can get crowded, but we still had great opportunities to watch the
      turtles. The crew was terrific - Jason, Jackson, and Shane. We would
      definitely recommend this activity, and will do it again if we ever get
      back to Hawaii!

      After such an exciting first day, we decided to take it a bit easier and
      just get a nice lunch as our day activity. Had a wonderful time getting an
      opportunity to walk around a few blocks of Ala Moana and sampling some of
      the local eats that you can't really get back home. Every stop had
      something new and interesting to try, and there wasn't a single thing I
      tried that I really disliked.
